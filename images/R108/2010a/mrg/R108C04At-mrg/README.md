- I took an old reconstruction from \\resstore.unibe.ch\ana_rs_schittny\data\Gruppe\AnaTera\AnaTera4\share\SLS\2010a\mrg\
- For easyness reasons only the top part of the stacked scan at TOMCAT
- Quick and dirty 'connected components' in Fiji on binned dataset, then selected one part of one acinus (#1378, IIRC)
- Created a composite image of the upscaled again acinus with the orignal data
- Used `R108C04A.animation.txt` to generate a quick animation and saved this animation to the `animation.frames` directory
- Ran `rename.ul . _ *.jpg` in the folder for easyness of loading the images in the presentation
